In this directory we have graphs create from the data in the `tables` directory.

Some observations.

For the standard cost model (one unit of time for each of "add", "subtract", "shift"), in the first 100 numbers there are only about a dozen numbers that are worse than the optimal method.

The average instruction sequence size for the first 10,000 numbers, although it has a rapid growth for about the first 100 numbers, grows very slowly, after that.
At 1,000 number average about 6 instructions while at about 10,000 the average number is about 7 instructions.
