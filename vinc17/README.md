This is a copy of the software in [Multiplication by Integer Constants](http://www.vinc17.net/research/mulbyconst/index.en.html#software).

However the Software, Practice and Experience code has been split out and put in its own directory, [_spe_](../spe86).

Raphaël Rigo's implementation (in C using GMP) of V. Lefèvre's latest algorithm is in directory [_rigo_](./rigo).

Possibly other code will be beefed up and split out as well.
