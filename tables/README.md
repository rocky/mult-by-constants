This area holds tables multiplication of sequences in JSON or YAML format.

It might be useful to load this in in a compiler to get optimum multiplication sequences for numbers that are in this table. Or it can be used as an internal multiplication table in a general multiplication routine.

If you find a mistake or better sequence, put in a pull request (PR).

These tables can also be used to gather statistics on how the optimum sequences grow, or can be used to compare against the effectiveness of various methods.
